# Furca Academy - Video Section Descriptions

These descriptions are designed to be placed alongside the video training modules to help users understand what they will learn in each section.

## Getting Started

### 1. Welcome to Furca
**Description:** A quick introduction to how Furca integrates seamlessly with Dentrix Ascend to prevent lost referrals, improve patient care, and boost practice revenue.

**Video Script:**
"Welcome to Furca! We’re here to solve a problem every dental practice faces: lost specialty referrals. Every time a patient is referred for specialty care but never schedules that appointment, it’s a missed opportunity for their health and your practice’s growth.

Furca fixes this by living right inside Dentrix Ascend. We track every single referral from the moment it’s created until the treatment is complete. No more sticky notes, no more lost paper forms, and no more patients slipping through the cracks.

In this training series, we’ll show you how to use Furca to create referrals in seconds, track them automatically, and ensure every patient gets the care they need. Let’s get started!"

### 2. Role Overview
**Description:** Learn how Furca adapts to your specific role. We'll show you the different features available for Back Office staff versus Office Managers and Specialty Coordinators.

**Video Script:**
"Furca is smart enough to show you exactly what you need for your job. Let’s look at how your role determines what you see.

If you work in the **Back Office**—like a doctor, hygienist or dental assistant—your main job is to identify care. You’ll see the 'New Referral' tab right in the patient’s chart, allowing you to create a referral in just a few clicks. You won’t be distracted by management tools; it’s all about speed and accuracy in the operatory.

If you’re a **Front Desk** or **Office Manager**, your dashboard expands. You’ll see the 'Unscheduled List'—your command center for tracking patients who need appointments. You also have the power to link appointments to referrals, log calls, and manage returning patients.

And for **Specialty Managers** overseeing a specialty for multiple locations, you get a bird’s-eye view of all referrals across the organization, filtered by specialty.

Knowing your role helps you focus on what matters most: helping patients take the next step."

### 3. Understanding Referrals Statuses
**Description:** Master the lifecycle of a referral. We break down every stage—from "New Referral" to "Completed"—so you always know exactly where a patient stands in their treatment journey.

**Video Script:**
"Every referral in Furca tells a story through its status. Let’s walk through the journey so you always know where a patient stands.

It starts with **New Referral**. This means a doctor has identified a need, but the front desk hasn’t processed it yet.

Once the front desk reviews it but the patient hasn’t booked an appointment, it becomes **Unscheduled**. These are the patients who need a phone call.

When an appointment is booked in Dentrix, the referral status flips to **Scheduled** after you link the appointment. 

On the day of the specialty appointment, the status changes to **In Progress**. This means the patient came in for their specialty appointment.

From the In Progress status, the front desk can tell Furca what happened during that appointment. Was it a consult appointment but treatment needs to be scheduled? Was a same day consult and treatment completed? Can the patient go back to the general dentist for restorative care? Furca will prompt the front desk to change the status of an In Progress referral based on what happened during the patient's specialty appointment."

When all work is done and the patient is ready to return to their general dentist, we mark it **Completed**.
The referral status then changes to **Returning**. This alerts the general office to book a follow-up or to review the referral if no restorative care is needed.


And if a patient declines care or moves away? We mark it **Voided** to keep your lists clean.

Understanding these statuses ensures no patient is ever left in limbo."

## Core Workflows

### 1. Creating a Referral
**Description:** See how to create a detailed digital referral in seconds directly from the patient's chart, including selecting teeth and adding notes.

**Video Script:**
"Creating a referral in Furca is fast—designed to be done chairside in under 30 seconds.

First, open the patient’s chart in Dentrix Ascend. This can either be done by searching for the patient in the search bar or clicking thier appointment on the dentrix calendar. Then, click the 'Create New Referral' tab located on the upper right side of the patient chart.

Notice that the patient’s info is already there. No typing names or birthdays.

Pick your **Provider** and **Location** if they aren’t auto-filled.
Then, select the **Destination Specialty**—like Periodontics or Oral Surgery.


Use the interactive tooth chart to tap the specific teeth involved. This visual is super helpful for the receiving office.

Finally, add a quick **Reason**—like 'Pleae evaluate site #2 for implant'.

Hit 'Confirm Referral', and you’re done! The referral is instantly visible to your front desk and the specialty team. It’s that simple."

### 2. Understanding the New Referral Status
**Description:** Learn what happens immediately after a referral is created. We explain the "New Referral" status and the critical first actions for the front desk.

**Video Script:**
"The moment a referral is created in the back office, it enters the **New Referral** status. This is the 'handoff' moment.

If you’re at the front desk, you’ll see a notification or a badge appear on the lower right side of the patient’s chart. Your goal is to catch this patient before they leave the office and attempt to schedule their specialty appointment. 


Open the sidepanel. You have three choices for new referrals:
1. **Patient Scheduled Referral Appointment:** If the patient is ready, book the appointment right then and there.
2. **Patient Did Not Scheduled Referral Appointment:** If they can’t book today, click this button. It moves them to your tracking list of unscheduled referrals so you remember to call them tomorrow.
3. **Referral was a mistake:** If the referral was made in error, you can cancel it here.

You can also print the referral and hand it to the patient by clicking the printer icon next to the patient name.

If you scroll down you will see all of the details from the referring dentist, where they are sending the referral and the referral reason by clicking the referrer/referral toggle buttons

The 'New Referral' status is temporary. It’s a holding pen that asks you: 'What are we doing with this patient today?' Always try to clear this status before the patient walks out the door."

### 3. The Unscheduled Referral List
**Description:** This is your command center. Learn how to filter, prioritize, and work through the Unscheduled Referrals list to ensure every patient gets booked.

**Video Script:**

Now we'll show you how to track and manage all referrals in unscheduled status: 

"This is your power tool: The Unscheduled Referral List. Think of this as your daily 'To-Do' list for patient care.

To find it, just go to the **Calendar** view in Dentrix. The Furca panel will automatically switch to show you everyone who needs an appointment or all unscheduled referrals.

You can filter this list by **Specialty** (for example, just show me Ortho patients or just show me patients who were referred from Lakeside Dental).

Click on a patient card to see their details. Call them up right from this screen.

If you leave a voicemail, click the **'Log Contact'** button. You can record 'Left Voicemail' or 'Spoke with Patient'. Furca will automatically 'snooze' this patient for a few days so you don’t annoy them, then bring them back to the top of your list later.

If you log 3 contact attempts with no answer, Furca can even auto-void the referral to keep your list clean.

This is especially useful for specialty managers that manage a particular specialty for multiple locations or office managers that have a specialty at their location.

Your goal? Get this list to zero every week."

### 4. Linking Appointments to Referrals
**Description:** The most critical step in the process. Learn how to link a Dentrix appointment to a Furca referral to automatically update its status and track patient compliance.

**Video Script:**
Now we'll show you how to link an appointment to a referral:

"Linking is the magic moment where Furca connects with Dentrix. This tells the system: 'Yes, this patient has an appointment!'

There are two ways to do this.

**Method 1: The Toast Notification (Fastest)**
When you create an appointment in the Dentrix calendar, look at the bottom right of your screen. A small pop-up (we call it a 'toast') will appear saying 'Link this appointment to John Doe’s Referral?'. Just click **'Yes, Link'**. Done.

**Method 2: Manual Linking**
If you missed the pop-up, open the patient’s referral card. You’ll see a 'Link Appointment' button. Click it, and Furca will show you a list of upcoming appointments for that patient. Select the correct one.

Once linked, the status changes to **Scheduled** automatically. This removes the patient from the unscheduled referral list and lets everyone know the patient is on the books. If a patient cancels their appointment, no shows or reschedules furca automatically picks this up and moves the referral to the appropriate status.

### 5. Understanding the In Progress Status
**Description:** Learn how to manage referrals that are currently undergoing treatment. We cover how to track patient progress and handle multi-visit procedures.

**Video Script:**
Now we'll show you how to handle referrals in the IN PROGRESS status. 

"When the appointment day arrives, the furca automatically flips the referral to **In Progress**. This means the patient is in the chair for a consult or has started their treatment plan.

For specialty teams, this is your active patient list. You don’t need to log phone calls anymore. Instead, you’re tracking clinical progress.

After the visit, open the referral and update the notes.
Was the consult and treatment finished in one visit? Great, mark it **Complete**.
Was a consult completed and the patient needs to come back for treatment? Mark the referral as unscheduled if the patient wasnt able to schedule that day and scheduled if the patient was able to schedule their follow-up appointment that day.

If the patient declined treatment, you can void the referral right from this screen.

This status lets the referring doctor know: 'We are taking care of your patient right now.'"

### 6. Completing a Referral
**Description:** How to properly close out a referral record when all treatment is finished to ensure accurate reporting and clean patient records.

**Video Script:**
"Closing the loop is vital. When a patient has finished their specialty treatment—like their root canal is completed or their implant is placed and integrated—it’s time to mark the referral as **Completed**.

Open the referral details. You’ll see a 'Complete Referral' button.

When you click this, two things happen:
1. The referral moves into your 'Completed' history, so it no longer clutters your active lists.
2. It logs a 'Win' in your analytics, showing that you successfully treated this patient.

It also sends a signal back to the general dentist that the specialty work is done and the patient is ready to come back to the referring dentist. Always complete your referrals to keep your data accurate!"

### 7. Understanding the Returning Referral Status
**Description:** Master the handoff process when a patient finishes specialty care and needs to return to your general office for restorative work.

**Video Script:**
"Sometimes, finishing specialty care is just the middle of the story. For example, after an implant is placed (specialty), the patient needs to go back for the crown (general).

This is where the **Returning** status comes in.

When a specialist marks a referral as 'Returning', it alerts the General Office Manager. You’ll see these patients in a special 'Returning Referrals' list.

Your job is to call them and say: 'Great news, Dr. Smith says your implant is ready. Let’s get you in for your crown.'

Once you schedule that general appointment, you can finally mark the entire referral chain as **Completed**. This ensures the patient doesn't get lost on their way back home to your practice."

## Advanced

### 1. Analytics & Reporting
**Description:** Discover how to track your practice's success with insights into referral volume, conversion rates, and recovered revenue.

**Video Script:**
"You can’t improve what you don’t measure. Furca’s analytics give you a clear picture of your referral health.

Open the **Analytics** tab to see:
- **Referral Volume:** How many patients are we referring out?
- **Conversion Rate:** What percentage actually schedule an appointment? (Industry average is 50%—with Furca, aim for 80%+!)
- **Revenue Recovered:** The estimated value of the treatments you saved from slipping away.

Use these reports in your monthly meetings to identify which locations are rockstars at follow-up and which ones might need a little help with their Unscheduled List."

### 2. Troubleshooting
**Description:** Quick solutions for common questions and technical tips to keep your daily workflow running smoothly.

**Video Script:**
"Run into a snag? Here are the most common quick fixes.

**'I don't see the Furca panel!'**
Make sure you are on a patient's chart or the calendar in Dentrix. If it’s still missing, check the Chrome extensions puzzle piece icon in the top right and make sure Furca is pinned and logged in.

**'The appointment isn't linking!'**
Check that the appointment is for the same patient and is in the future. Furca won’t link to appointments in the past.

**'The data looks wrong!'**
Try hitting the refresh button at the top of the Furca panel. Since we sync with Dentrix, sometimes a quick refresh pulls in the latest updates.

If you’re still stuck, click the 'Support' link in the settings menu. We’re here to help!"
